# Annual-Holiday-Revenue-and-Customer-Behavior-Metrics
Developed an interactive dashboard analyzing Christmas sales data (2018-2023) to optimize revenue strategies. This project involved using advanced Excel formulas to process ,customer demographics, and payment methods. Insights gained identified key growth areas and improved operational efficiency for the retail operations team.

QUESTIONS (KPI)
The dashboard is designed to answer several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) critical for a retail business: 
•	Overall Performance: What are the total sales and profit margins?
•	Seasonal Trends: How do sales fluctuate across different holiday events (e.g., Black Friday vs. Christmas Market)?
•	Customer Insights: Which age groups are the primary purchasers, and what is the gender distribution of customers?
•	Location Performance: Which locations are the top revenue generators?
•	Payment Preferences: Which payment methods are most popular (Credit Card, Online Payment)?
•	Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: How have sales trends evolved from 2018 to 2021? 


PROCESS
The image represents the final visualization and reporting stage of a data analysis project. The typical process would involve several steps: 
1.	Requirement Gathering: The administrator, James Divine, likely defined the KPIs and objectives required for this report.
2.	Data Collection & Cleaning: Raw sales data was gathered from point-of-sale (POS) systems and prepared for analysis.
3.	Data Analysis & Modeling: The data was analyzed using a business intelligence (BI) tool (like Power BI, based on visual similarities) to create the various charts and calculations (e.g., profit margins, trends, customer stats).
4.	Dashboard Creation: The insights were then visualized into this interactive dashboard format using charts, graphs, and slicers. 
DASHBOARD PROJECT INSIGHT
•	High Revenue & Profit: The business generated over $1.1 million in sales and $733k in gross profit.
•	Age Group Demographics: Specific age groups (e.g., 18-22, 23-27) appear to contribute significantly to sales.
•	Location Dominance: Specific locations drive a majority of the revenue.
•	Payment Preferences: Credit card usage appears high compared to online payments.
•	Steady Customer Base: Over half (50.65%) of customers were retained, indicating strong customer loyalty.

FINAL CONCLUSION

The data suggests a successful holiday season with strong revenue and a solid customer base. The project likely concludes that strategies implemented during Black Friday and the Christmas period were effective. Actionable recommendations might involve optimizing inventory for top locations and age groups, or leveraging the high customer retention rate for future campaigns.
